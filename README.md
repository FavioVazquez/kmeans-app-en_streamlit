# App for visualizing K-means step-by-step (made in Python)

For didactic purposes, I made this app providing text explanation and animated graphic visualization of the K-means algorithm.

For simulation data, I used [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and for animation and graphical representation, [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).
For app deployment, [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) has been used.
